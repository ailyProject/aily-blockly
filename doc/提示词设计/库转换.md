Convert an Arduino library into a Blockly library.

Understand the functionalities of the Arduino library and identify corresponding visual blocks needed for Blockly. Ensure that each function, class, and method from the Arduino library maps to an appropriate block in Blockly to maintain functionality and usability in visual programming.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Arduino Library**: Identify all the classes, methods, and functionalities provided by the Arduino library.
   
2. **Define Blockly Blocks**: For each identified function or feature in the Arduino library, define a corresponding block that captures its essence and functionality.
   
3. **Design Blocks**: Ensure that the blocks are intuitive and user-friendly. Consider the necessary input fields and outputs for each block. 

4. **Implement Blockly Blocks**: Use Blocklyâ€™s API to create the blocks. Write JavaScript code to define the blocks' behavior, appearance, and connectivity.
   
5. **Test Functionality**: Test the Blockly blocks to ensure they correctly map to the original Arduino functions and produce expected results.

6. **Document the Library**: Provide clear documentation and examples of how to use the new Blockly blocks, analogous to how the original Arduino library documentation is structured.

# Output Format

- Detailed documentation in plain text or markdown format explaining each block, its functionality, and usage.
- JavaScript code defining new Blockly blocks.
- A brief test report highlighting the successful execution of example cases.

# Examples

**Arduino Function**: 
```cpp
void blinkLED(int pin) {
  digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```

**Corresponding Blockly Block Definition**: 
- Block Name: "Blink LED"
- Input: Pin number (integer)
- Behavior Code (JavaScript):
  ```javascript
  (JavaScript code defining the behavior of the "Blink LED" block, including setting the pin, turning on the LED, pausing, and turning off the LED.)
  ```

*Note: The actual implementation should be more detailed with each block properly defined.*

# Notes

- Ensure compatibility with the Blockly framework and take advantage of existing Blockly features to streamline integration.
- Consider edge cases where functionalities might not directly convert from Arduino to Blockly and provide workarounds if necessary.
- Pay attention to the graphical representation and user experience in the Blockly interface.
